PROJECT PROCESS:

1.Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

2.Conducted initial exploration:

 -Checked for null values.

 -Examined data types and statistical summaries (df.info(), df.describe()).

 -Visualized distributions and correlations using Histograms,Boxplots,Pairplots,Heatmaps

3.Data Preprocessing:

 -Handled missing values and duplicate values.

 -Encoded categorical feature Region using One-Hot Encoding.
 
 -Handled outlier values using median imputation.

4.Model Selection with Random States

 -Ran multiple experiments with different random_state values (40 to 50).

 -Observed test accuracies to identify the most stable and highest-performing model.

 -Random State 46 was chosen as it yielded the highest test accuracy (0.798 for Linear Regression).

5.Model Fitting

 -Important features for prediction are chosen.

 -Tested different models like linear regression,SVR,Random forest,XGBoost etc. and after comparing all models

  Random Forest was selected as the best performing model
