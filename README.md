The objective of this project is to develop and compare machine learning models to predict a key insurance metric (such as insurance charges) based on customer features. By leveraging different regression algorithms, the goal is to identify the most accurate and generalizable model that can assist insurance companies in decision-making, risk assessment, and pricing strategies.
