CONCLUSION:

Insights from EDA-

1.Smoking significantly increases insurance charges – smokers (blue points) have much higher costs than non-smokers, forming a separate cluster.The difference is huge, with smokers paying nearly 3x more than non-smokers.

2.Age and charges show a positive correlation – older individuals tend to have higher insurance costs.

3.BMI and charges have a weak positive relationship – higher BMI slightly increases insurance charges, especially for smokers.

4.Number of children has little to no impact on charges – no clear trend is visible.

5.Males have slightly higher average insurance charges than females.However, the difference is not very significant, meaning gender does not have a strong impact on charges.

6.Southeast region has the highest average charges




Model fitting-

We tried four models: Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, and XGBoost and after comparing all models

Random Forest was selected as the best performing model. 



Random Forest:

Train R² ≈ 0.97

Test R² ≈ 0.86 → best test performance.
